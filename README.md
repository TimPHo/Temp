Prerequisites
------------
Install the following from https://nodejs.org

* node `^4.2.0`
* npm `^3.0.0`

In order for this application to function, you must have a version of the Haystack.Dataservices project accessible
via `https://localhost:44300`


Getting Started
---------------

Just clone the repo and install the necessary node modules:

```shell
$ npm install                   # Install Node modules listed in ./package.json (may take a while the first time)
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

If you haven't already please add the following to your ignored names list in Atom or Sublime.
`.git, .hg, .svn, .DS_Store, Thumbs.db, .codekit-cache, bower_components, node_modules`

An es-linter plugin will be very useful for development. For atom an easy one is `linter-eslint`

Usage
-----

Before delving into the descriptions of each available npm script, here's a brief summary of the three which will most likely be your bread and butter:

* Doing live development? Use `npm start` to spin up the dev server.
* Compiling the application to disk? Use `npm run compile`.


Great, now that introductions have been made here's everything in full detail:

* `npm start` - Spins up Koa server to serve your app at `localhost:3000`. HMR will be enabled in development.
* `npm run compile` - Compiles the application to disk (`~/dist` by default).
* `npm run dev:nw` - Same as `npm start`, but opens the redux devtools in a new window.
* `npm run dev:no-debug` - Same as `npm start` but disables redux devtools.
* `npm run test` - Runs unit tests with Karma and generates a coverage report.
* `npm run test:dev` - Runs Karma and watches for changes to re-run tests; does not generate coverage reports.
* `npm run deploy`- Runs linter, tests, and then, on success, compiles your application to disk.
* `npm run lint`- Lint all `.js` files.
* `npm run lint:fix` - Lint and fix all `.js` files. [Read more on this](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/command-line-interface.html#fix).

**NOTE:** Deploying to a specific environment? Make sure to specify your target `NODE_ENV` so webpack will use the correct configuration. For example: `NODE_ENV=production npm run compile` will compile your application with `~/build/webpack/_production.js`.

### Configuration

Basic project configuration can be found in `~/config/_base.js`. Here you'll be able to redefine your `src` and `dist` directories, adjust compilation settings, tweak your vendor dependencies, and more. For the most part, you should be able to make changes in here **without ever having to touch the webpack build configuration**. If you need environment-specific overrides, create a file with the name of target `NODE_ENV` prefixed by an `_` in `~/config` (see `~/config/_production.js` for an example).

Common configuration options:

* `dir_src` - application source code base path
* `dir_dist` - path to build compiled application to
* `server_host` - hostname for the Koa server
* `server_port` - port for the Koa server
* `compiler_css_modules` - whether or not to enable CSS modules
* `compiler_devtool` - what type of source-maps to generate (set to `false`/`null` to disable)
* `compiler_vendor` - packages to separate into to the vendor bundle

Structure
---------

The folder structure provided is only meant to serve as a guide, it is by no means prescriptive. It is something that has worked very well for me and my team, but use only what makes sense to you.

```
.
├── bin                      # Build/Start scripts
├── build                    # All build-related configuration
│   └── webpack              # Environment-specific configuration files for webpack
├── config                   # Project configuration settings
├── server                   # Koa application (uses webpack middleware)
│   └── main.js              # Server application entry point
├── src                      # Application source code

```

Webpack
-------

### Vendor Bundle
You can redefine which packages to bundle separately by modifying `compiler_vendor` in `~/config/_base.js`. These default to:

```js
[
  'history',
  'react',
  'react-redux',
  'react-router',
  'react-router-redux',
  'redux'
]
```

### Globals

These are global variables available to you anywhere in your source code. If you wish to modify them, they can be found as the `globals` key in `~/config/_base.js`. When adding new globals, also add them to `~/.eslintrc`.

* `process.env.NODE_ENV` - the active `NODE_ENV` when the build started
* `__DEV__` - True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `development`
* `__PROD__` - True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `production`
* `__TEST__` - True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `test`
* `__DEBUG__` - True when `process.env.NODE_ENV` is `development` and cli arg `--no_debug` is not set (`npm run dev:no-debug`)
* `__BASENAME__` - [npm history basename option](https://github.com/rackt/history/blob/master/docs/BasenameSupport.md)

Testing
-------

To add a unit test, simply create a `.spec.js` file anywhere in `~/tests`. Karma will pick up on these files automatically, and Mocha and Chai will be available within your test without the need to import them.

Coverage reports will be compiled to `~/coverage` by default. If you wish to change what reporters are used and where reports are compiled, you can do so by modifying `coverage_reporters` in `~/config/_base.js`.

Deployment
----------

By running `npm run compile` a static website will be generated in the `~/dist` folder.

If you are serving the application via a web server such as nginx, make sure to direct incoming routes to the root `~/dist/index.html` file and let react-router take care of the rest. The Koa server that comes with the starter kit is able to be extended to serve as an API or whatever else you need, but that's entirely up to you.
